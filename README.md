# Every Day Is Leg Day

Welcome to the Leg dAPI, a backend application that supports users planing and tracking their own workouts. The concept for this project came to me while I was working out in the gym, and realized that I couldn't for the life of me remember what weights I was using in my last workout. I realized that what I needed was a simple way to track my weight lifting workouts, and that having a database of different lifts at my fingertips wouldn't hurt either. 

Leg dAPI is backed by a PostgreSQL database with a very simple layout.
